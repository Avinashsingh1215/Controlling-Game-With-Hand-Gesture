# Controlling-Game-With-Hand-Gesture

# 🎮 Game Control Using Hand Gestures
A computer vision project that enables users to control a game using real-time hand gesture recognition via webcam. This project combines MediaPipe, OpenCV, and Python to detect and track hand landmarks and trigger game actions based on predefined gestures.

## 📄 Description
This project demonstrates the integration of computer vision with interactive gameplay by recognizing hand gestures in real time. It provides a touch-free way to control in-game movements, simulating inputs like jump, shoot, move, etc., based on gestures like a fist, palm, or finger pointing.

## 🎯 Objectives
- **Build a real-time hand gesture recognition system using webcam input**.

- **Map specific gestures to game controls (e.g., jump, shoot, move)**.

- **Provide an intuitive, touchless way to play games**.

## 🛠️ Features
Real-time hand tracking using MediaPipe Hands

- **Custom gesture recognition with landmark analysis**.

- **Game interaction (keyboard emulation or game-specific API)**.

- **FPS monitoring and gesture overlay on the video feed**.

## 📽️ Demo
🔴 Add a short GIF or YouTube link demonstrating how you control the game with your hand.
(You can use tools like ScreenToGif or OBS Studio for recording.)

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- **Python**.

- **OpenCV**.

- **MediaPipe**.

- **pyautogui or keyboard for game control**.
